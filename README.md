# ytdl-utilities
A little script I made for me and my friends got make preserving yotube videos and songs easier

FFMPEG.exe and YT-DLP.exe not shown in repository bc file upload limits

Origialy made this in March, 2021 but decided to upload v2 to github so more people can find it and preserve videos without having to worry about the CLI for yt-dlp or youtube-dl
